# arrange
This is a small app in Objective C.
It basically plays sounds after you select the scales.


You can search by Chord or create your own progression.

CFTreeRef has been used as a DataStructure.
The tree is created and then populated in the AppDelegate.
Different accessor methods are created to get elements at certain depths.

Its a great intro to **CFTreeRef** DataStructure if anyone is ever interested in it.

Obviously you can create your own tree data structure from scratch but if Apple provides one why bother re-inventing the wheel.


Also please note this app only runs on iPad.
